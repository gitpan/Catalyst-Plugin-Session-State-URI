Revision history for Perl extension Catalyst::Plugin::Session::State::URI

0.11    2009-07-25
        - When rewriting URIs, avoid doubled slashes. While this is
          mostly a cosmetic problem, if you issue a redirect with a
          URI like "//-/...", some browsers (or Firefox 3.0, at least)
          may get very confused. (Dave Rolsky)

0.10    2009-07-11
        - Separate rewrite config item into rewrite_body and
          rewrite_redirect. The old config setting will still
          work. (Dave Rolsky)
        - Shut up warnings from test code with newer Catalyst-Runtime.
          (Dave Rolsky)

0.07    2006-10-13
        - Fix dependencies (URI::Find was in the Build.PL, but M::B is being
          phased out so the makefile wasn't regenerated)

0.05    2006-08-01
        - DWIM behavior when using both State::Cookie and State::URI together,
          through App->config->{session}{no_rewrite_if_cookie}.
        - Add App->config->{session}{rewrite_types} = [qw/.../] support.

        - rerelase with proper version dependencies
